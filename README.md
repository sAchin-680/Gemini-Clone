    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Configuration

1. **Set up your Google API key**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add your **Google API key**:
      ```bash
      VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
      ```

2. **Configure any other necessary environment variables** for your project.

### Running the Application

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

2. Open the app in your browser:

    services:
      - type: web
        name: gemini-clone
        env: node
        plan: free
        buildCommand: yarn build
        startCommand: yarn serve
    ```

2. Push your code to your GitHub repository and link it with Render for automatic deployment.

3. Make sure to add the **Google API key** as an environment variable in the Render dashboard.
